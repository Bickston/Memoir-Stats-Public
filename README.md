# Memoir Statistics Project

Welcome to the Memoir Statistics Project! My name is Bickston Laenger, and I embarked on the journey of writing my memoir in September 2022. Since then, I've diligently worked on it and have managed to accumulate nearly 500,000 words in total.

Alongside my memoir writing, I've been developing this project. It's designed to analyze any text input and generate fun and useful statistics. Whether you're curious about word counts, sentence structures, or unique vocabulary usage, this project has you covered.

Feel free to use my code for your own projects, experiments, or just for fun! I believe in sharing knowledge and fostering creativity, so I welcome anyone to explore and adapt this project to suit their needs.

I must confess, the code isn't the most elegant or polished, but it gets the job done efficiently. Remember, the primary goal here is to have fun and explore the world of text analytics.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or contributions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's continue to learn and grow together!
